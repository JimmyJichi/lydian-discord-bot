## FAQ & common issues

Firstly, check the [issues page](https://github.com/svioletg/viMusBot/issues) to see if your problem has already been reported or solved. Most bugs are kept track of there — this page is only for issues that I cannot seem to fix, and require workarounds.

### Trying to queue a Spotify playlist results in a "Command raised an exception: SpotifyException: http status: 404..." message

This is normally caused by the playlist being something dynamically generated by Spotify, like a Blend playlist. As these playlists are created for each user individually, it wouldn't be possible for the bot to retrieve them unless it had your Spotify credenetials — of which I have no intention to allow it access to such.
