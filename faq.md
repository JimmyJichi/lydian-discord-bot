> Trying to queue a Spotify playlist results in a "Command raised an exception: SpotifyException: http status: 404..." message

This is normally caused by the playlist being something dynamically generated by Spotify, like a Blend playlist. I'm looking into this, but as a workaround in the interim you can manually make a new playlist and add the Blend's tracks to it, and then play that with the bot - if you're on desktop, Spotify allows you to shift-click tracks (and Ctrl+A for everything) to make this easier.

> YouTube links download extremely slowly, sometimes multiple minutes for one small file

Firstly, check the internet connection of wherever you're hosting the bot from. If the connection itself doesn't look like the cause, you can try updating the `yt_dlp` package (`pip install -U yt_dlp`) - usually any throttling from YouTube will be fixed by them soon after.
