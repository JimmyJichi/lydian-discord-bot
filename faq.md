> Trying to queue a Spotify playlist results in a "Command raised an exception: SpotifyException: http status: 404..." message

This is normally caused by the playlist being something dynamically generated by Spotify, like a Blend playlist. I'm looking into this, but as a workaround in the interim you can manually make a new playlist and add the Blend's tracks to it, and then play that with the bot - if you're on desktop, Spotify allows you to shift-click tracks (and Ctrl+A for everything) to make this easier.
