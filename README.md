Feel free to submit an [issue](https://github.com/svioletg/viMusBot/issues/new) if you have a bug to report or a feature to request, and feel free to comment on existing issues to provide any additional details that may help narrow down the issue or reach a solution. No bug or feature is too large/small to be submitted, this system is best for me to keep track of everything.

Otherwise feel free to look around, I suppose. Use this code to help in whatever projects you're developing, etc. I would not recommend using this code to learn Python or programming in general - I try to comment as much as possible but it's bound to be messy.
