## TODO

---

A bot made in Python 3.10 using the [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) library, for personal usage.

Please submit an [issue](https://github.com/svioletg/viMusBot/issues/new) if you've experienced a bug or otherwise odd behavior, or have a feature to request, and feel free to comment on existing issues to provide any additional details that may help narrow down the issue or reach a solution. No bug or feature is too large/small to be submitted, this system is best for me to keep track of everything.

Feel free to use this for your own server or fork it for your own project, but I'll stress that I'm a hobbyist programmer first and foremost, and this is far from a perfect project - there's probably better options, my coding is fairly messy, etc. etc.

To run this yourself you'll need:
- Python 3.10.8
- Required Python packages (run `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- A `token.txt` file containing your bot's token
- A `config.json` file for your Spotify API credentials
- A `headers_auth.json` file for ytmusicapi; see [here](https://ytmusicapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup.html) for more details
