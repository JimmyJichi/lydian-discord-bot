# viMusBot

## Using the Console

Added in v1.9.0, the **console** lets you type and run commands into the terminal or window the bot is running in. Note that these "commands" are entirely separate from the "commands" you would use on Discord itself — most of them are just for getting some basic information, or for developer debugging usage.

You can see a full list of currently available commands below. Commands are entered without any prefix, and are case-insensitive. Less-than and greater-than signs indicate **required parameters**, like `<this>`, while square brackets indicate **optional parameters**, like `[this]`. If the bot sends a log message while typing a command, it may appear disconnected or pushed up — the console will still count this as the same string, so just continue typing and it will send perfectly fine.
