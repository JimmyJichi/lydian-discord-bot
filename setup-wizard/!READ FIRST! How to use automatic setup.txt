Install the latest version of Python from this page: https://www.python.org/downloads/

This script will automatically download the required files and help set up some configuration for you, but Python is required for it to run in the first place.

When you start the installer, make sure to check ON the box at the bottom, that says "Add Python 3.x to your PATH" (replace 3.x with whatever version you have).

Once Python has finished installing, if you'd like to avoid using the command line you can double-click "vmbsetup.bat" if you're on Windows, or "vmbsetup.sh" if you're on Linux or Mac.

Otherwise, you can open a command prompt or terminal, navigate to this directory, and run "python3 vmbsetup.py" to begin.
